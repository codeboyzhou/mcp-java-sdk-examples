= MCP Server Examples

Built Using Pure https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk[MCP Java SDK] â€“ No Spring Framework Required.

Moreover, if you are looking for an easier way to develop your own MCP server, perhaps you will also be interested in my another repository https://github.com/codeboyzhou/mcp-declarative-java-sdk[Annotation-driven MCP Java SDK], it's based on the native MCP Java SDK, and similarly No Spring Framework required.

== Requirements

- Java 17 or later (Restricted by MCP Java SDK)

== What is MCP?

The https://modelcontextprotocol.io[Model Context Protocol (MCP)] lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!

You can start exploring everything about *MCP* from https://modelcontextprotocol.io[here].

== Examples

If you are looking for servers implemented with Typescript MCP SDK or Python MCP SDK, see https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers[here].

These servers aim to demonstrate MCP features and the MCP Java SDK.
